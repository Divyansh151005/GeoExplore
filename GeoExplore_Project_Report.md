## Significance of Derivative Layers for Mineral Targeting

### Fault Proximity Analysis
Fault zones serve as critical conduits for mineralizing fluids. Our buffer analysis identifies areas within optimal distances from fault lines (typically 1-10 km), which represent high-potential zones for hydrothermal mineral deposits, especially for gold, REE, and copper mineralization.

### Structural Intersections
The intersection of fault lines and fold axes creates zones of enhanced permeability and structural traps. Our spatial analysis identifies these intersection points, which are prime locations for mineral concentration and represent priority exploration targets. These are particularly significant for Ni-PGE deposits.

### Lithological Favorability
Certain rock types show strong correlations with specific mineral deposits. Our lithological analysis identifies:
- Mafic/ultramafic rocks favorable for Ni-PGE deposits
- Altered granitic rocks favorable for REE mineralization
- Metamorphic-sedimentary contacts favorable for gold mineralization

### Density-Based Features
Regions with high fault density often indicate intensive tectonic activity and enhanced fluid movement. Our density rasters highlight areas of structural complexity that correlate strongly with mineralization potential across multiple commodity types.

3. **Confusion Matrix Analysis**
   - High precision and recall for gold and REE targets (>0.85)
   - Strong performance for copper targeting (F1-score >0.82)

This project emphasizes the importance of a knowledge-driven approach to mineral exploration, where machine learning algorithms enhance rather than replace geological expertise. The identified targets represent promising areas for focused exploration efforts, potentially leading to the discovery of new mineral resources critical for India's technological and industrial development.
