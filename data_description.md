# Geological Data Description

This document provides information about the geological data files used in the GeoExplore platform for mineral exploration in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

## Shapefile Data

The platform uses the following shapefiles:

### 1. Lithology Data (`lithology_gcs_ngdr.shp`)

This shapefile contains geological lithology data (rock types) for the study area. The data is in the WGS84 geographic coordinate system.

Key attributes:
- Lithology types
- Geological ages
- Formation details

### 2. Fault Line Data (`fault_gcs_ngdr_20250224141337303.shp`)

This shapefile represents fault lines in the study area. Faults are important geological structures that can influence mineralization.

Key attributes:
- Fault type
- Orientation
- Length

### 3. Fold Structure Data (`Fold.shp`)

This shapefile contains fold structures in the geological formations. Folds can create favorable conditions for mineral deposition.

Key attributes:
- Fold type
- Orientation
- Associated structures

## Coordinate Reference System

All shapefiles use the Geographic Coordinate System WGS 1984 (GCS_WGS_1984) with the following parameters:
- Datum: D_WGS_1984
- Spheroid: WGS_1984 (6378137.0, 298.257223563)
- Prime Meridian: Greenwich (0.0)
- Angular Unit: Degree (0.0174532925199433)

## Data Sources

The data was provided for a geological mapping project covering parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, India, with a focus on identifying potential areas for exploration of critical minerals.

## Data Usage

The GeoExplore platform utilizes this data to:
1. Visualize geological features
2. Perform spatial analysis
3. Identify correlations between geological features and mineral deposits
4. Generate predictive models for mineral potential
